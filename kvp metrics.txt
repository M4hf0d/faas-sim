High CPU utilization events (>90%):
HPST: 0 events
LPLT: 0 events

Average power per active node:
HPST: 3.04W
LPLT: 3.08W

==================================================
HYPOTHESIS VALIDATION SUMMARY
==================================================
✅ H2: LPLT has faster cold start performance
✅ H3: LPLT scales more conservatively (less churn)
