# Error Analysis and Fix Plan

## The Problem

The error occurs because the `FunctionDeployment` object doesn't have an `image` attribute. Looking at the `FunctionDeployment` class structure from the attachments, the correct way to access the image is through the function containers.

## Root Cause

In your deployments.py file, line 43 tries to access `deployment.image`, but `FunctionDeployment` objects store images differently. The image information is stored in the `fn_containers` list.

## Fix Plan

### Step 1: Understand FunctionDeployment Structure

From the attachments, `FunctionDeployment` has:

- `fn`: Function object
- `fn_containers`: List of FunctionContainer objects
- `scaling_config`: ScalingConfiguration
- `ranking`: DeploymentRanking

### Step 2: Fix the Deployment Creation

Replace the problematic `FunctionDeployment` creation in deployments.py:

```python
# Replace the create_smart_city_function_instances function with this corrected version:

def create_smart_city_function_instances(
    base_deployments: Dict[str, FunctionDeployment],
    instance_counts: Dict[str, int]
) -> List[FunctionDeployment]:
    """
    Create multiple instances of each function for smart city scenarios.

    Args:
        base_deployments: Dictionary of base function deployments
        instance_counts: How many instances of each function to create

    Returns:
        List of expanded function deployments
    """
    expanded_deployments = []

    for func_name, deployment in base_deployments.items():
        count = instance_counts.get(func_name, 1)

        for i in range(count):
            if i == 0:
                # Use the original deployment for the first instance
                expanded_deployments.append(deployment)
            else:
                # Create a new deployment with unique name
                new_name = f"{func_name}-zone-{i}"

                # Create a new function object with the new name
                new_function = copy.deepcopy(deployment.fn)
                new_function.name = new_name

                # Copy the function containers
                new_fn_containers = copy.deepcopy(deployment.fn_containers)

                # Create a new deployment with the correct structure
                from sim.faas.core import FunctionDeployment
                new_deployment = FunctionDeployment(
                    fn=new_function,
                    fn_containers=new_fn_containers,
                    scaling_config=copy.deepcopy(deployment.scaling_config),
                    deployment_ranking=copy.deepcopy(deployment.ranking)
                )

                # Copy any additional attributes that might exist
                for attr in dir(deployment):
                    if (not attr.startswith('_') and
                        not callable(getattr(deployment, attr)) and
                        attr not in ['fn', 'fn_containers', 'scaling_config', 'ranking', 'name']):
                        try:
                            value = getattr(deployment, attr)
                            setattr(new_deployment, attr, copy.deepcopy(value))
                        except:
                            pass  # Skip attributes that can't be copied

                expanded_deployments.append(new_deployment)

    return expanded_deployments
```

### Step 3: Update Imports

Make sure you have the correct imports at the top of deployments.py:

```python
import copy
from typing import Dict, List
from sim.faas.core import FunctionDeployment  # Make sure this import is correct
from ext.raith21.deployments import create_all_deployments
from ext.raith21.oracles import Raith21ResourceOracle, Raith21FetOracle
```

### Step 4: Alternative Simpler Approach

If the above approach is still problematic, use a simpler method that just reuses the original deployments multiple times:

```python
def create_smart_city_function_instances(
    base_deployments: Dict[str, FunctionDeployment],
    instance_counts: Dict[str, int]
) -> List[FunctionDeployment]:
    """
    Create multiple instances by reusing original deployments.
    """
    expanded_deployments = []

    for func_name, deployment in base_deployments.items():
        count = instance_counts.get(func_name, 1)

        # Add the original deployment multiple times
        for i in range(count):
            expanded_deployments.append(deployment)

    return expanded_deployments
```

## Expected Results

After this fix, you should get:

- **27 function deployments** with the default scenario (6+10+4+5+2)
- Much better utilization of your 500 devices
- No more AttributeError about missing `image` attribute

This simplified approach reuses the original deployment objects multiple times, which will result in multiple replicas of each function being created during the simulation, giving you the device utilization you're looking for.
