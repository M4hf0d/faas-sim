Records with high wait percentage (>50%): 72
  resnet50-inference: 2 records, avg 63.1% wait
  speech-inference: 36 records, avg 93.8% wait
  python-pi: 12 records, avg 88.4% wait
  resnet50-preprocessing: 22 records, avg 93.8% wait

Records with high response times (>204325.3ms): 12
  resnet50-preprocessing: 12 records, avg 392839.3ms

SCALING RECOMMENDATIONS
======================

python-pi:
  ✅ ACCEPTABLE: Wait times within reasonable range

resnet50-inference:
  ✅ ACCEPTABLE: Wait times within reasonable range

resnet50-preprocessing:
  🔴 CRITICAL: Very high wait times - immediate scaling needed
  ⚠️  High response times detected - investigate bottlenecks

speech-inference:
  🔴 CRITICAL: Very high wait times - immediate scaling needed
  ⚠️  High response times detected - investigate bottlenecks
