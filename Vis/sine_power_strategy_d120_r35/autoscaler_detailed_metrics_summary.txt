PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
===================

Records with high wait percentage (>50%): 96
  speech-inference: 64 records, avg 93.4% wait
  python-pi: 4 records, avg 78.8% wait
  resnet50-preprocessing: 28 records, avg 93.7% wait

Records with high response times (>111631.6ms): 24
  resnet50-preprocessing: 20 records, avg 213278.0ms
  speech-inference: 4 records, avg 112642.5ms

SCALING RECOMMENDATIONS
======================

python-pi:
  ✅ ACCEPTABLE: Wait times within reasonable range

resnet50-inference:
  🟢 GOOD: Low wait times - consider scaling down if consistent

resnet50-preprocessing:
  🔴 CRITICAL: Very high wait times - immediate scaling needed
  ⚠️  High response times detected - investigate bottlenecks

speech-inference:
  🔴 CRITICAL: Very high wait times - immediate scaling needed
  ⚠️  High response times detected - investigate bottlenecks
