SCALING RECOMMENDATIONS
======================

python-pi:
  ✅ ACCEPTABLE: Wait times within reasonable range

python-pi-downtown:
  ✅ ACCEPTABLE: Wait times within reasonable range

python-pi-suburb:
  ✅ ACCEPTABLE: Wait times within reasonable range

resnet50-inference:
  🟢 GOOD: Low wait times - consider scaling down if consistent

resnet50-inference-downtown:
  🟢 GOOD: Low wait times - consider scaling down if consistent

resnet50-inference-industrial:
  🟢 GOOD: Low wait times - consider scaling down if consistent

resnet50-inference-suburb:
  🟢 GOOD: Low wait times - consider scaling down if consistent

resnet50-preprocessing:
  🔴 CRITICAL: Very high wait times - immediate scaling needed
  ⚠️  High response times detected - investigate bottlenecks

speech-inference:
  🟢 GOOD: Low wait times - consider scaling down if consistent
