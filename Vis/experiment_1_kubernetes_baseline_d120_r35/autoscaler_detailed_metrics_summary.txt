PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
===================

Records with high wait percentage (>50%): 42
  resnet50-inference: 4 records, avg 60.4% wait
  python-pi: 12 records, avg 93.7% wait
  speech-inference: 26 records, avg 95.6% wait

Records with high response times (>101690.9ms): 10
  speech-inference: 10 records, avg 182908.9ms

SCALING RECOMMENDATIONS
======================

python-pi:
  ‚úÖ ACCEPTABLE: Wait times within reasonable range

resnet50-inference:
  ‚úÖ ACCEPTABLE: Wait times within reasonable range

speech-inference:
  üî¥ CRITICAL: Very high wait times - immediate scaling needed
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  High response times detected - investigate bottlenecks
