SCALING RECOMMENDATIONS
======================

python-pi:
  🟢 GOOD: Low wait times - consider scaling down if consistent

resnet50-inference:
  🟢 GOOD: Low wait times - consider scaling down if consistent

resnet50-preprocessing:
  🔴 CRITICAL: Very high wait times - immediate scaling needed
  ⚠️  High response times detected - investigate bottlenecks

speech-inference:
  🟡 WARNING: Moderate wait times - consider scaling up
  ⚠️  High response times detected - investigate bottlenecks
