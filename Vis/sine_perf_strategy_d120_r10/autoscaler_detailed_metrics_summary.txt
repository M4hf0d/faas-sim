  resnet50-preprocessing: 8 records, avg 91.4% wait

Records with high response times (>11962.7ms): 10
  speech-inference: 2 records, avg 12364.2ms
  resnet50-preprocessing: 8 records, avg 110589.5ms

SCALING RECOMMENDATIONS
======================

python-pi:
  🟢 GOOD: Low wait times - consider scaling down if consistent

resnet50-inference:
  🟢 GOOD: Low wait times - consider scaling down if consistent

resnet50-preprocessing:
  🔴 CRITICAL: Very high wait times - immediate scaling needed
  ⚠️  High response times detected - investigate bottlenecks

speech-inference:
  ✅ ACCEPTABLE: Wait times within reasonable range
