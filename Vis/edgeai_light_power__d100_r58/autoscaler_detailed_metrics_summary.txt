SCALING RECOMMENDATIONS
======================

python-pi:
  üü° WARNING: Moderate wait times - consider scaling up

resnet50-inference:
  ‚úÖ ACCEPTABLE: Wait times within reasonable range

resnet50-preprocessing:
  ‚úÖ ACCEPTABLE: Wait times within reasonable range
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  High response times detected - investigate bottlenecks

speech-inference:
  ‚úÖ ACCEPTABLE: Wait times within reasonable range
