SCALING RECOMMENDATIONS
======================

python-pi:
  ✅ ACCEPTABLE: Wait times within reasonable range

resnet50-inference:
  ✅ ACCEPTABLE: Wait times within reasonable range

resnet50-preprocessing:
  🔴 CRITICAL: Very high wait times - immediate scaling needed
  ⚠️  High response times detected - investigate bottlenecks

speech-inference:
  🟡 WARNING: Moderate wait times - consider scaling up
  ⚠️  High response times detected - investigate bottlenecks
