PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
===================

Records with high wait percentage (>50%): 42
  resnet50-inference: 4 records, avg 63.8% wait
  python-pi: 12 records, avg 93.9% wait
  speech-inference: 26 records, avg 95.4% wait

Records with high response times (>157392.5ms): 8
  speech-inference: 8 records, avg 280980.3ms

SCALING RECOMMENDATIONS
======================

python-pi:
  ‚úÖ ACCEPTABLE: Wait times within reasonable range

resnet50-inference:
  ‚úÖ ACCEPTABLE: Wait times within reasonable range

speech-inference:
  üî¥ CRITICAL: Very high wait times - immediate scaling needed
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  High response times detected - investigate bottlenecks
