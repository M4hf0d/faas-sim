# **Research Foundation and Inspirations** üìö

The node selection strategies in your implementation are inspired by several established research areas and algorithmic approaches. Let me break down the academic foundations:

## **1. Bin Packing Algorithms (Classical Computer Science)**

### **First-Fit Strategy:**

```python
class FirstFitNodeSelector(NodeSelector):
    def select_best_node(self, deployment_name: str, available_nodes: List[Any]):
        for node in available_nodes:  # ‚Üê Classic First-Fit
            if self.has_sufficient_resources(node, deployment_name):
                return node
```

**Academic Foundation:**

- **Original Paper**: Johnson, D.S. (1973). "Near-optimal bin packing algorithms"
- **Algorithm Class**: Online bin packing algorithms
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is number of nodes
- **Approximation Ratio**: 1.7 (proven bound for First-Fit)

## **2. Energy-Aware Computing Research**

### **Power-Optimized Strategy:**

```python
self.power_efficiency_ranking = {
    'coral': 2.5,     # Most efficient
    'nano': 1.9,
    # ...
    'xeongpu': 75.0   # Least efficient
}
```

**Research Inspirations:**

### **b) Energy-Aware Task Scheduling**

- **Seminal Work**: Koomey, J. et al. (2011). "Implications of historical trends in the electrical efficiency of computing"
- **Energy-Performance Trade-offs**: Your strategy accepts longer execution time for lower energy
- **Heterogeneous Systems**: Different device types with varying energy characteristics

## **3. Performance-Aware Scheduling**

### **Performance-Optimized Strategy:**

```python
self.performance_ranking = {
    'xeongpu': 10,    # Best performance
    'xeoncpu': 9,
    # ...
    'coral': 1        # Specialized only
}

# Workload-aware optimization
if 'inference' in deployment_name.lower() and node_type in ['xeongpu', 'nx', 'tx2']:
    adjusted_performance += 2
```

## **4. Multi-Objective Optimization**

### **Hybrid Strategy:**

```python
def select_best_node(self, deployment_name: str, available_nodes: List[Any]):
    # Calculate power score (lower power = higher score)
    power_score = 1.0 / max(power_consumption, 0.1)

    # Calculate performance score
    performance_score = 1.0 / max(exec_time, 1.0)

    # Combine scores
    hybrid_score = (self.power_weight * power_score +
                   self.performance_weight * performance_score)
```
