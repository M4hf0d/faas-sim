## 6. Code to Extract Power Models from Existing Data

You can actually derive some power coefficients from your existing `FunctionResourceCharacterization` data by correlating it with known power measurements:

```python
def derive_power_coefficients(resource_data, device_power_measurements):
    """
    Derives power coefficients from existing resource characterization data

    Args:
        resource_data: Dictionary of FunctionResourceCharacterization objects
        device_power_measurements: Dictionary with measured power for specific function/device pairs

    Returns:
        Dictionary of power coefficients per device type
    """
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

    # Organize data by device type
    device_data = {}

    # Group resource data by device
    for (device, image), char in resource_data.items():
        if device not in device_data:
            device_data[device] = []

        # Get the measured power if available
        power = device_power_measurements.get((device, image), None)
        if power is not None:
            device_data[device].append((
                char.cpu_util,  # CPU utilization
                char.disk_io,   # Disk I/O
                char.gpu_util,  # GPU utilization
                char.memory,    # Memory usage
                char.network_io * 1024 * 1024,  # Convert to bytes/sec
                power           # Measured power in watts
            ))

    # Calculate coefficients for each device type
    power_coefficients = {}
    for device, measurements in device_data.items():
        if len(measurements) < 5:  # Need enough data points
            continue

        # Convert to numpy arrays
        X = np.array([[cpu, disk, gpu, mem, net] for cpu, disk, gpu, mem, net, _ in measurements])
        y = np.array([power for _, _, _, _, _, power in measurements])

        # Fit linear regression model
        model = LinearRegression()
        model.fit(X, y)

        # Extract coefficients
        power_coefficients[device] = {
            'baseline': model.intercept_,  # Base power consumption
            'cpu': model.coef_[0],         # CPU coefficient
            'disk': model.coef_[1],        # Disk coefficient
            'gpu': model.coef_[2],         # GPU coefficient
            'memory': model.coef_[3],      # Memory coefficient
            'network': model.coef_[4]      # Network coefficient
        }

    return power_coefficients
```

## 7. Commercial Device Testing Labs

If you need highly accurate measurements, consider:

1. **[TechInsights](https://www.techinsights.com/)**: Detailed technical analysis of devices
2. **[AnandTech](https://www.anandtech.com/)**: Publishes detailed power analysis in their reviews
