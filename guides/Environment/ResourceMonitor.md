# ResourceMonitor Class: Detailed Analysis

## What It Is

The `ResourceMonitor` class is a background process (SimPy process) that continuously samples and records resource utilization data throughout the simulation execution. It's a key component for tracking how resources (CPU, memory, GPU, etc.) are used over time by function replicas running in the simulated environment.

```python
class ResourceMonitor:
    """Background process that periodically samples and records resource utilization"""

    def __init__(self, env: Environment, reconcile_interval: int, logging=True):
        self.env = env
        self.reconcile_interval = reconcile_interval  # How often to sample resource usage
        self.metric_server: MetricsServer = env.metrics_server
        self.logging = logging
```

## How It Works

### 1. Initialization

The constructor takes three key parameters:

- **`env`**: The simulation environment with access to the system state, faas, metrics, etc.
- **`reconcile_interval`**: How frequently (in simulation time units) to sample resource usage
- **`logging`**: Boolean flag to enable/disable logging of resource metrics

### 2. Main Collection Process

The core functionality is in the `run()` method:

```python
def run(self):
    """SimPy process that runs throughout simulation, collecting resource metrics"""
    faas: FaasSystem = self.env.faas
    while True:
        # Wait for next collection interval
        yield self.env.timeout(self.reconcile_interval)
        now = self.env.now

        # Iterate through all running function replicas
        for deployment in faas.get_deployments():
            for replica in faas.get_replicas(deployment.name, FunctionState.RUNNING):
                # Get current resource usage for this replica
                utilization = self.env.resource_state.get_resource_utilization(replica)
                if utilization.is_empty():
                    continue

                # Log metrics and add to metrics server timeseries
                if self.logging:
                    self.env.metrics.log_function_resource_utilization(replica, utilization)
                self.metric_server.put(
                    ResourceWindow(replica, utilization.list_resources(), now))
```

Step by step, the method:

1. **Enters an infinite loop** - The monitoring process continues for the entire simulation duration
2. **Waits for the next interval** - Using `yield self.env.timeout(self.reconcile_interval)` to pause until the next sampling time

3. **Records the current time** - Stores the current simulation time as `now`

4. **Iterates through deployments and replicas**:
   - Gets all function deployments in the system
   - For each deployment, finds all replicas that are in the `RUNNING` state
5. **Collects resource utilization**:
   - For each running replica, retrieves its current resource utilization from `env.resource_state`
   - Skips replicas with no resource utilization (empty)
6. **Records utilization data** in two ways:
   - If logging is enabled, logs function resource utilization via `env.metrics`
   - Always stores a snapshot (`ResourceWindow`) in the `metric_server` containing:
     - The function replica
     - Its current resource usage (CPU, memory, GPU, etc.)
     - The current timestamp

### 3. Data Flow

The monitoring process creates a data flow through these key components:

1. `ResourceState` → `ResourceMonitor` → `MetricsServer` → Analysis tools

The `ResourceMonitor` acts as a bridge between the active resource state and the historical metrics storage.

## Why It's Important

The `ResourceMonitor` serves several critical purposes in the simulation:

1. **Performance Analytics**: It provides the data needed to analyze resource usage patterns across different nodes, functions, and time periods

2. **Resource Utilization Tracking**: It helps identify bottlenecks, overloaded nodes, or underutilized resources

3. **Scheduler Evaluation**: The collected data can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of different scheduling strategies

4. **Decision Making**: It provides data that could be used by autoscalers, load balancers, or other decision-making components

5. **Simulation Validation**: It allows for verifying that resources are being correctly claimed and released throughout function execution

6. **Time Series Analysis**: By regularly sampling at fixed intervals, it enables temporal analysis of resource consumption patterns

## Integration Point for Energy Modeling

This class is the perfect integration point for energy modeling because:

1. It already periodically samples resource usage across all nodes
2. It has access to the complete utilization data for all resources (CPU, GPU, memory, etc.)
3. It can be extended to calculate power consumption based on resource utilization
4. It already interfaces with the metrics system, making it easy to add energy metrics
5. The periodic sampling creates natural time windows for energy calculation (power × time)

To implement energy modeling, you would extend this class to:

1. Calculate power consumption based on current resource utilization
2. Track energy consumption by accumulating (power × time interval) between samples
3. Log both power and energy metrics using the existing metrics infrastructure
