Hereâ€™s a **detailed description of every RPS (requests per second) profile** in your requestgen.py, with clear examples for each. This will help you understand how each profile works and when to use it.

---

## 1. **constant_rps_profile(rps)**

**Description:**  
Generates a constant RPS value. Every time you call `next()`, it yields the same RPS.

**Example:**

```python
gen = constant_rps_profile(10)
print(next(gen))  # 10
print(next(gen))  # 10
```

**Use case:**  
Simulate a steady stream of requests, e.g., 10 requests per second, with no variation.

---

## 2. **sine_rps_profile(env, max_rps, period)**

**Description:**  
Generates RPS values that follow a sine wave pattern over simulation time (`env.now`). The RPS oscillates smoothly between 0 and `max_rps`, with a full cycle every `period` seconds.

**Example:**

```python
gen = sine_rps_profile(env, max_rps=20, period=60)
for _ in range(5):
    print(next(gen))  # Values will rise and fall between 0 and 20 as env.now increases
```

**Use case:**  
Model periodic load, such as traffic that peaks and dips (e.g., day/night cycles).

---

## 3. **randomwalk_rps_profile(mu, sigma, max_rps, min_rps=0)**

**Description:**  
Generates RPS values using a random walk (normal distribution). Each value is based on the previous one, with random variation (`sigma`). Values are clamped between `min_rps` and `max_rps`.

**Example:**

```python
gen = randomwalk_rps_profile(mu=10, sigma=2, max_rps=20)
for _ in range(5):
    print(next(gen))  # Values will wander randomly, but stay within [0, 20]
```

**Use case:**  
Simulate unpredictable but bounded traffic, such as user-driven load with random spikes.

---

## 4. **static_arrival_profile(rps_generator, max_ia=math.inf)**

**Description:**  
Converts an RPS generator into inter-arrival times (seconds between requests). For each RPS value, yields `1/rps` (capped by `max_ia`). If RPS is zero, yields `max_ia`.

**Example:**

```python
rps_gen = constant_rps_profile(5)
ia_gen = static_arrival_profile(rps_gen)
print(next(ia_gen))  # 0.2 (since 1/5 = 0.2 seconds between requests)
```

**Use case:**  
Turn any RPS profile into a stream of request timings for scheduling.

---

## 5. **expovariate_arrival_profile(rps_generator, scale=1.0, max_ia=math.inf)**

**Description:**  
Similar to `static_arrival_profile`, but inter-arrival times are drawn from an exponential distribution (`random.expovariate(lam)`), where `lam` is the current RPS. This models a Poisson process (random arrivals).

**Example:**

```python
rps_gen = constant_rps_profile(10)
ia_gen = expovariate_arrival_profile(rps_gen)
print(next(ia_gen))  # Random value, average ~0.1 seconds, but varies
```

**Use case:**  
Simulate real-world random arrivals, e.g., web requests, where requests are not perfectly spaced.

---

## 6. **pre_recorded_profile(file)**

**Description:**  
Loads a pre-recorded sequence of inter-arrival times from a pickle file.

**Example:**

```python
ia_gen = pre_recorded_profile("my_profile.pkl")
print(next(ia_gen))  # Uses saved timings
```

**Use case:**  
Replay a previously observed or generated traffic pattern.

---

## 7. **function_trigger(env, deployment, ia_generator, max_requests=None)**

**Description:**  
Consumes an inter-arrival time generator (`ia_generator`) and schedules requests for a deployment in the simulation environment. If `max_requests` is set, only that many requests are generated.

**Example:**

```python
env.process(function_trigger(env, deployment, ia_gen, max_requests=100))
```

**Use case:**  
Actually drive the simulation by generating requests according to your chosen profile.

| Profile Name                | Pattern/Distribution    | Example Use Case                |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| constant_rps_profile        | Fixed RPS               | Steady, predictable load        |
| sine_rps_profile            | Periodic (sine wave)    | Day/night cycles, periodic load |
| randomwalk_rps_profile      | Random walk (normal)    | Unpredictable, fluctuating load |
| static_arrival_profile      | Deterministic intervals | Precise scheduling              |
| expovariate_arrival_profile | Poisson (random)        | Real-world random arrivals      |
| pre_recorded_profile        | Custom/replayed         | Replay real traffic             |

---

- Use `constant_rps_profile` for simple tests.
- Use `expovariate_arrival_profile` for realistic, random arrivals.
- Use `sine_rps_profile` or `randomwalk_rps_profile` for more complex, time-varying loads.
