# Understanding Function Placement in the Simulation Environment

Based on the code I see, you're working with a complex urban sensing simulation environment where different devices (Raspberry Pi, Jetson devices, XeonGPU, etc.) are placed strategically in a geographic layout. You're concerned about whether you can assign specific functions to specific devices.

## Function Placement Control Options

You actually **do have several ways to control function placement** in this simulation:

### 1. Using Node Label Predicates

The simulation uses Kubernetes-style scheduling with predicates to filter suitable nodes:

```python
# In ext/raith21/main.py
predicates.extend([
    CanRunPred(fet_oracle, resource_oracle),
    NodeHasAcceleratorPred(),
    NodeHasFreeGpu(),
    NodeHasFreeTpu()
])
```

You can create custom predicates that explicitly match functions to specific devices:

```python
class RunOnSpecificNodePred(Predicate):
    def __init__(self, function_to_node_mapping):
        self.mapping = function_to_node_mapping

    def passes_predicate(self, context: ClusterContext, pod: Pod, node: Node) -> bool:
        if pod.metadata.name in self.mapping:
            return node.name in self.mapping[pod.metadata.name]
        return True  # Allow other functions to run anywhere
```

### 2. Using Function Container Labels

In `deployments.py`, you can see functions already have labels that restrict where they can run:

```python
# From deployments.py (for GPU function)
labels={'watchdog': 'http', 'workers': '4', 'device.edgerun.io/accelerator': 'GPU',
        'device.edgerun.io/vram': '1500'}
```

You can extend this to include specific node targeting:

```python
labels={'target.node': 'specific-node-name-here'}
```

Then add a predicate that enforces this constraint.

### 3. Using PodHostEqualsNode Predicate

This existing predicate ensures pods run only on specified hosts:

```python
# In exdave/vienna_smart_city_scenario/main.py
scheduler.predicates.append(PodHostEqualsNode())
```

You can leverage this by adding a `hostname` to your function's pod specification.

### 4. Creating a Custom Topology

The urban sensing topology is highly configurable. You could modify how devices are placed within the city:

```python
# In ext/raith21/topology.py
class HeterogeneousUrbanSensingScenario(UrbanSensingScenario):
    # This class creates neighborhoods with specific device types
```

You could customize this to create a topology where certain devices are placed exactly where you want them.

## Recommended Approach

For your energy modeling work, I recommend:

1. **Create a custom predicate** that maps functions to specific nodes based on your strategic device placement

2. Add this to your scheduler configuration:

   ```python
   # Map functions to nodes for energy data collection
   function_node_mapping = {
       'resnet50-inference': ['nx_0', 'tx2_1'],  # Run only on these devices
       'mobilenet-inference': ['coral_0', 'nano_2']
   }
   predicates.append(RunOnSpecificNodePred(function_node_mapping))
   ```

3. Ensure the devices you want are correctly placed in your topology configuration

This approach allows you to capture specific energy consumption data from strategically placed devices while maintaining the existing simulation architecture.
