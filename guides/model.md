# Understanding the Raith21 Example: A Thinking Model and Roadmap

To thoroughly understand and explain the Raith21 example in the faas-sim framework, I'll provide a structured thinking model that gradually builds up your comprehension from fundamentals to advanced concepts.

## 1. The Big Picture: What is Raith21?

Raith21 is a sophisticated example implementation in the faas-sim framework that simulates serverless function execution across heterogeneous edge and cloud environments. Named after Philipp Raith (one of the faas-sim authors), it:

- Models AI workloads running on diverse hardware platforms (from Raspberry Pi to high-end servers)
- Uses trace-driven simulation based on real-world measurements
- Demonstrates edge computing concepts with complex topologies and realistic workload patterns

## 2. Core Components: A Layered Approach

### Layer 1: Device Infrastructure

- generator.py: Creates simulated devices with realistic hardware specifications
- `etherdevices.py`: Converts abstract device descriptions to network topology nodes
- topology.py: Builds an urban sensing topology connecting edge, fog, and cloud nodes

### Layer 2: Function Characteristics

- resources.py: Contains resource consumption measurements for functions on different devices
- `fet.py`: Contains Function Execution Time distributions from real-world traces
- images.py: Defines container images for various AI workloads

### Layer 3: Simulation Logic

- oracles.py: Provides predictions about execution times and resource requirements
- `predicates.py`: Defines scheduling constraints for function placement
- `functionsim.py`: Simulates function execution behavior based on traces
- `benchmark/constant.py`: Generates workload patterns with specified request rates

### Layer 4: Output Analysis

- extract.py: Processes simulation metrics into structured dataframes

## 3. Execution Flow: How It All Works Together

1. **Setup Phase:**

   - Generate device ecosystem (`generate_devices`)
   - Convert to network topology (`convert_to_ether_nodes`)
   - Create oracles for performance prediction (`Raith21FetOracle`, `Raith21ResourceOracle`)

2. **Configuration Phase:**

   - Define function deployments (`create_all_deployments`)
   - Configure scheduler with predicates and priorities
   - Set up benchmark parameters (`ConstantBenchmark`)

3. **Initialization Phase:**

   - Create network topology (`urban_sensing_topology`)
   - Initialize environment components (scheduler, metrics, FaaS system)
   - Set up function simulators (`AIPythonHTTPSimulatorFactory`)

4. **Execution Phase:**

   - Run simulation (`sim.run()`)
   - Process generated events
   - Collect performance metrics

5. **Analysis Phase:**
   - Extract metrics into dataframes
   - Process results for visualization and insights

## 4. Key Datasets to Understand

### Device Specifications

- Different device types (rpi3, rpi4, tx2, nx, etc.) with varying capabilities
- Network connectivity patterns in urban environments

### Function Resource Characterization

Each function on each device type is characterized by:

- CPU utilization (fraction of total CPU)
- Disk I/O rate (KB/s)
- GPU/TPU utilization (fraction of accelerator)
- Memory usage (KB)
- Network I/O rate (MB/s)

Example from resources.py:

```python
('rpi3', 'faas-workloads/resnet-inference-cpu'): FunctionResourceCharacterization(
    0.5448381974407112,  # CPU usage: ~54% of the CPU
    2615.734632324097,   # Disk I/O: ~2.6 MB/s
    0,                   # GPU usage: None (CPU version)
    2062539.5723288062,  # Memory: ~2 GB
    0.36519032690251113  # Network: ~0.37 MB/s
)
```

### Function Execution Time (FET) Distributions

- Statistical distributions modeling execution times
- Parameters vary based on function type and device hardware

## 5. Implementation Details: Understanding the Code

### Main Script Flow (main.py)

1. **Import necessary modules** (lines 1-30)
2. **Set random seeds** for reproducibility (lines 32-33)
3. **Generate devices ecosystem** (lines 35-37)
4. **Create oracles** for performance prediction (lines 39-40)
5. **Set up deployments and function images** (lines 42-43)
6. **Configure scheduler** with predicates and priorities (lines 45-57)
7. **Define workload pattern** (line 60)
8. **Initialize topology** (lines 62-63)
9. **Set up environment** with all components (lines 65-75)
10. **Run simulation** (lines 77-78)
11. **Extract and display metrics** (lines 80-99)

### Scheduling Logic

- Default predicates (node has resources, node selector match)
- Custom predicates (CanRunPred, NodeHasAcceleratorPred, etc.)
- Priorities from vanilla.get_priorities() that determine which nodes are preferred

## 6. Practical Analysis: Understanding the Results

When you run `ext.raith21.main`, it produces several dataframes:

1. **invocations_df**: Records each function invocation with timing details
2. **scale_df**: Tracks auto-scaling events for functions
3. **schedule_df**: Records scheduling decisions and their outcomes
4. **replica_deployment_df**: Shows where function replicas were deployed
5. **flow_df**: Captures data flow between nodes (network traffic)
6. **fets_df**: Contains detailed function execution time measurements

Key metrics to analyze:

- Average execution times per function/device
- Wait times (queueing delays)
- Resource utilization patterns
- Network transfer volumes

## 7. Advanced Concepts: What Makes Raith21 Special

1. **Heterogeneity Modeling**

   - Different hardware platforms with unique performance characteristics
   - Specialized accelerators (GPUs, TPUs) with different capabilities

2. **Trace-Driven Simulation**

   - Uses empirical measurements rather than theoretical models
   - Captures real-world performance variations

3. **Complex Topology**

   - Urban sensing scenario with realistic network characteristics
   - Edge-fog-cloud hierarchy

4. **Hardware-Aware Scheduling**
   - Specialized predicates for GPU and TPU availability
   - Consideration of function execution characteristics

## 8. Extending the Example: Your Next Steps

1. **Modify Workload Parameters**

   - Change `rps` (requests per second) to vary load intensity
   - Adjust `duration` to simulate longer/shorter periods

2. **Experiment with Different Device Configurations**

   - Change `num_devices` to scale the simulation size
   - Modify device mix in `cloudcpu_settings`

3. **Implement Custom Scheduling Policies**

   - Add new predicates to target specific use cases
   - Modify priorities to optimize for different objectives

4. **Create Custom Analysis Visualizations**
   - Process the output dataframes for insights
   - Compare results across different configurations

By working through this roadmap, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of the Raith21 example and be able to explain its components, execution flow, and significance in serverless edge computing research.
