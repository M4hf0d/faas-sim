faas-sim was originally created in 2019 at the Distributed Systems Group of TU
Wien by Thomas Rausch. Conceptually it was heavily influenced by PipeSim [1], a
simulator developed by Thomas Rausch and colleagues at IBM Research.

Since then the development of faas-sim was driven by the following people.

	Thomas Rausch <thomas@thrau.at>
	Alexander Rashed <https://github.com/alexrashed>
	Philipp Raith <p.raith@dsg.tuwien.ac.at>
