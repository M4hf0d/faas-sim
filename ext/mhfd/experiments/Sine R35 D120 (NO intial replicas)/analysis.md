### **Load Distribution :**

```

35 RPS across 6 functions = 5.8 RPS per function average

Sine wave peaks: ~11.6 RPS per function (max_rps = rps×2)

```

## **Power Consumption Analysis**

### **Power Results:**

| Strategy | Total Power | Power vs K8s       | Energy (Wh) | Power Ranking   |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------ | ----------- | --------------- |
| **K8s**  | 507.3W      | Baseline           | 211.9 Wh    | **3rd (worst)** |
| **LPLT** | 506.5W      | **+0.2% (better)** | 211.6 Wh    | **2nd**         |
| **HPST** | 466.1W      | **+8.1% (better)** | 194.7 Wh    | **1st (best)**  |

### ** HPST Power Efficiency Dominance**

**Evidence from power distribution breakdown:**

```

K8s power consumption:

rockpi: 34 nodes × 4.0W = 136.1W

nx: 14 nodes × 12.9W = 181.0W

Total: 507.3W across 120 nodes



HPST power consumption:

rockpi: 34 nodes × 3.8W = 128.5W (-5.6%)

nx: 14 nodes × 11.4W = 160.3W (-11.4%)

Total: 466.1W across 120 nodes

```

**Why HPST wins power efficiency:** This is most likely because HPST's device avoidance strategy forces consolidation on fewer, more efficient nodes, reducing total infrastructure power consumption despite using "high-power" devices individually.

## **Performance Analysis**

### **Response Time Performance:**

| Strategy | Median RT | Performance vs K8s | P95 RT  | P95 vs K8s          |
| -------- | --------- | ------------------ | ------- | ------------------- |
| **K8s**  | 1,130s    | Baseline           | 46,718s | Baseline            |
| **LPLT** | 1,178s    | **-4.2% (worse)**  | 46,718s | **Same**            |
| **HPST** | 1,082s    | **+4.3% (better)** | 12,364s | **+73.5% (better)** |

### **HPST Performance **

HPST achieves:

- **4.3% better median response time** than K8s

- **73.5% better P95 response time** than K8s (12,364s vs 46,718s)

**Analysis from scaling actions:**

```

Scaling Actions Comparison:

K8s: 803 actions (74 up, 729 down) → 9.9:1 down/up ratio

LPLT: 778 actions (74 up, 704 down) → 9.5:1 down/up ratio

HPST: 1,360 actions (265 up, 1,095 down) → 4.1:1 down/up ratio

```

**Why HPST achieves better performance:** This is most likely because:

1.  **More aggressive scaling** (1,360 vs 803 actions) maintains optimal resource allocation

2.  **High-performance node preference** reduces execution bottlenecks

3.  **Better tail latency management** through avoiding slow low-power devices

## **Scaling Behavior Analysis**

### **Node Usage and Consolidation Patterns:**

| Strategy | Nodes Used | Avg Replicas/Node | Total Deployments |
| -------- | ---------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| **K8s**  | 11 nodes   | 35.2              | 387               |
| **LPLT** | 12 nodes   | 32.1              | 385               |
| **HPST** | 55 nodes   | 23.2              | 1,275             |

### **Consolidation vs Performance Trade-off**

**From node distribution:**

```

K8s: 387 deployments across 11 nodes = 35.2 replicas/node

HPST: 1,275 deployments across 55 nodes = 23.2 replicas/node

```

**from K8s code (khpa.py lines 115-125):**

```python

# K8s LeastRequestedPriority promotes consolidation:

cpu_score = (1.0  - utilization.get('cpu',  0)) *  100

scores['least_requested'] = (cpu_score + memory_score) /  2

total_score = scores['least_requested'] *  6.0  +  # Main priority

```

**Why K8s consolidates better:** This is most likely because K8s's LeastRequestedPriority actively prefers nodes with existing workload, while HPST's device selection strategy spreads across many nodes to find "optimal" devices.

## **Anomaly & Possible Explanations**

### **HPST "High-Power" Strategy Achieves Best Power Efficiency**

**Expected**: HPST should consume more power (focuses on high-power devices)

**Actual**: HPST consumes 8.1% LESS power than K8s

**Why this happens:** This is most likely because HPST's "high-performance" focus actually means **avoiding inefficient low-power devices** rather than **selecting power-hungry devices**. The heavy penalties in the code logic force HPST to use mid-range efficient devices (NUC, NX) while avoiding the numerous idle RPi devices.

### **LPLT Minimal Power Advantage Despite "Power Focus"**

**Expected**: LPLT should significantly outperform K8s in power efficiency

**Actual**: LPLT achieves only 0.2% better power than K8s

**Evidence from LPLT code:**

```python

# From lplt.py lines 25-45 - LPLT power efficiency ranking:

self.power_efficiency_ranking = {

'rpi3':  1,  # 1.4W - Lowest power

'nano':  2,  # 2.0W - BUT has GPU acceleration

'coral':  4,  # 2.5W - BUT has TPU acceleration

}

```

**Why LPLT fails:** This is most likely because LPLT's power rankings are based on **idle power consumption specifications** but under actual load (35 RPS), accelerated devices (nano GPU, coral TPU) consume significantly more power than their idle ratings, negating the theoretical efficiency advantage.

### ** K8s Worst Power Performance Despite "Balance"**

**Expected**: K8s should achieve middle-ground performance between LPLT and HPST

**Actual**: K8s has highest power consumption (507.3W)

**from K8s device selection:**

```python

# From khpa.py lines 140-155 - K8s device class scoring:

function_requirements = {

'resnet50-inference':  'gpu-accelerated',  # Selects power-hungry NX devices

'resnet50-training':  'gpu-accelerated',  # Selects power-hungry devices

'speech-inference':  'edge-optimized',  # Mixed device selection

}

```

**Why K8s consumes more power:** This is most likely because K8s's workload-aware device matching **actively selects power-hungry GPU devices** (NX: 12.9W each) for ML workloads, while HPST's device avoidance strategy accidentally avoids these high-power devices in favor of more efficient mid-range options.

## **Strategy vs Implementation**

### **Design Intent vs Actual Behavior Assessment:**

**K8s (Workload-Aware Balanced):**

- **Design Intent**: Balance performance and efficiency through intelligent device matching

- **Implementation**: Successfully implements device class scoring

- **Unexpected Result**: Workload awareness leads to higher power consumption by selecting appropriate but power-hungry devices

**LPLT (Power-Obsessed):**

- **Design Intent**: Minimize power through low-power device selection

- **Implementation**: Power rankings based on idle specifications, not load-adjusted consumption

- **Unexpected Result**: "Efficient" accelerated devices consume more power under load than expected

**HPST (Performance-Obsessed):**

- **Design Intent**: Maximize performance through high-power device selection

- **Implementation**: Successfully avoids slow devices, but accidentally selects efficient mid-range devices

- **Unexpected Result**: "Performance focus" leads to best power efficiency through device avoidance

## **Research Hypothesis Assessment**

### **Original Hypothesis**: "K8s is better because it's workload-aware and matches workloads to appropriate hardware"

**Verdict: HYPOTHESIS PARTIALLY VALIDATED BUT WITH IMPORTANT CAVEATS**

### **What Your Data Supports:**

**K8s implements true workload awareness** (device class scoring proven in code)

**K8s achieves better consolidation** (11 nodes vs HPST's 55)

**K8s demonstrates sophisticated algorithm design** (multi-objective scoring)

### **What Your Data Challenges:**

**K8s achieves worst power efficiency** (507.3W vs HPST's 466.1W)

**K8s achieves worst performance** (1,130s vs HPST's 1,082s)

**Single-objective HPST dominates both power AND performance metrics**

### **Refined Understanding:**

The hypothesis about workload awareness is **technically correct** but K8s does implement intelligent workload-device matching. However, under moderate/high load conditions (35 RPS), **this workload awareness actually hurts overall efficiency** because it selects appropriate but power-hungry devices when more efficient alternatives could handle the workload adequately.
