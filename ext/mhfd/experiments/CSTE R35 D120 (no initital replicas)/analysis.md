## **2. Context Validation Analysis**

### **Experimental Design Assessment:**

**Excellent design choices:**

- **Single initial replica** → True cold-start stress test
- **120 devices, 6 NUCs** → Realistic heterogeneous edge environment
- **35 RPS across 6 functions** → Moderate load requiring scaling decisions
- **600s duration** → Sufficient for steady-state analysis
- **Light scenario** → Mixed workload testing (ML + CPU + Training)

### **Why Single Initial Replica Matters:**

This is methodologically **brilliant** - it forces each strategy to demonstrate its true scaling philosophy without bias from pre-positioned replicas. It reveals which strategies can scale efficiently from minimal state.

## **3. Power Consumption Analysis Framework**

### **Strategy-by-Strategy Power Decomposition:**

**K8s (Baseline - Workload Aware):**

- **Total Replicas**: 1,726 (moderate, disciplined scaling)
- **Node Distribution**: 37 nodes (selective consolidation)
- **Power Efficiency**: 3.13W per replica (excellent efficiency)
- **Total Workload Power**: 5,404.5W

**LPLT (Energy Obsessed):**

- **Total Replicas**: 2,320 (+34% more than K8s!)
- **Node Distribution**: 119 nodes (massive over-distribution)
- **Power Efficiency**: 3.52W per replica (12% worse than K8s)
- **Total Workload Power**: 8,168.6W (+51% more than K8s!)

**HPST (Performance Focused):**

- **Total Replicas**: 2,293 (+33% more than K8s)
- **Node Distribution**: 119 nodes (similar over-distribution to LPLT)
- **Power Efficiency**: 3.58W per replica (14% worse than K8s)
- **Total Workload Power**: 8,206.1W (+52% more than K8s!)

### **Critical Insight #1: The Over-Provisioning Trap**

```
Both LPLT and HPST fell into the same trap:
- Started with 1 replica per function (6 total)
- Scaled to 2,300+ replicas (38x growth!)
- K8s scaled to 1,726 replicas (29x growth - more disciplined)

Result: LPLT's "energy efficiency" backfired spectacularly
```

## **5. Node Selection Strategy Analysis**

### **Device Selection Philosophy Revealed:**

**K8s Node Selection (Workload Aware):**

- **NUC**: 238 selections → High-performance for demanding tasks
- **RockPi**: 67 selections → Balanced performance/power
- **NX**: 34 selections → GPU for ML workloads
- **Strategy**: **Intelligent workload-device matching**

**LPLT Node Selection (Obsessive):**

- **Coral**: 1,936 selections (**100% obsession with TPUs!**)
- **Strategy**: **Pathological fixation on single "efficient" device**

**HPST Node Selection (Performance First):**

- **NUC**: 309 selections → High-performance preference

## **6. Performance Analysis Under Resource Pressure**

### **Multi-Dimensional Performance Assessment:**

**Response Time Performance:**

- **K8s**: 1,521ms median (good balance)
- **LPLT**: 1,267ms median (**16.7% better than K8s!**)
- **HPST**: 1,158ms median (best median performance)

**Tail Latency (95th Percentile):**

- **K8s**: 7,929ms (poor tail performance)
- **LPLT**: 4,705ms (**40.7% better tail latency than K8s!**)
- **HPST**: 7,129ms (moderate tail performance)

### **Critical Insight #4: The Over-Provisioning Performance Paradox**

```
LPLT's massive over-provisioning (2,320 replicas) accidentally created:
- Better median response times (more replicas = more parallelism)
- Much better tail latency (resource contention avoidance)
- But at 51% higher energy cost!

This reveals the performance vs. energy efficiency trade-off
```

CPU Tasks:       LPLT ≈ HPST > K8s  (Over-provisioning/performance wins)
Training:        HPST > LPLT > K8s  (Performance focus wins)
General Balance: K8s > HPST > LPLT  (Workload awareness wins overall)
```

## **10. Research Insights and Future Work**

### **Novel Research Findings:**

**Finding 1: Over-Provisioning Performance Paradox**

> LPLT's energy-focused over-provisioning accidentally improved performance metrics but wasted 51% more energy, revealing the complex relationship between replica count, performance, and efficiency.

**Finding 2: Scale-Down Discipline as Strategy Differentiator**

> Resource management discipline (scale-down behavior) matters more than node selection preferences for total energy efficiency in edge computing.

### **Refined Research Statement:**

> "In heterogeneous edge computing with minimal initial deployment, **workload-aware autoscaling (K8s-inspired) achieves superior energy efficiency** (51% better) **and balanced performance** through intelligent hardware-workload matching and disciplined resource management, while single-objective strategies (LPLT power focus, HPST performance focus) fail due to poor scaling discipline despite achieving their primary objectives."

### **Your Contribution to the Field:**

1. **Demonstrated** workload-aware scheduling's superiority over single-objective optimization
2. **Revealed** the critical importance of scale-down discipline in edge computing
3. **Identified** the over-provisioning performance paradox in distributed systems
