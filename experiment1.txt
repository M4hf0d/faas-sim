=== RUNNING HYPOTHESIS TEST  ===
Hypothesis: LPLT reduces power consumption vs K8s baseline, but increases response times

=== POWER CONSUMPTION COMPARISON ===
Kubernetes average power: 3.4W
LPLT average power: 3.1W
Power savings: 7.2%

=== PERFORMANCE COMPARISON (ROBUST METRICS) ===
Kubernetes MEDIAN response time: 1043.369s
LPLT MEDIAN response time: 1222.847s
MEDIAN performance penalty: 17.2%
Kubernetes 95th percentile: 216352.659s
LPLT 95th percentile: 31391.652s
95th percentile penalty: -85.5%
Kubernetes warm-up avg: 40726.902s
LPLT warm-up avg: 7519.070s
Warm-up performance penalty: -81.5%

=== WAIT TIME ANALYSIS ===
/mnt/c/Users/masay/Documents/FaaS/FS/faas-sim/script.py:61: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in double_scalars
  wait_improvement = ((k8s_wait_median - lplt_wait_median) / k8s_wait_median) * 100
K8s median wait time: 0.000s
LPLT median wait time: 0.000s
Wait time improvement: nan%

=== REVISED HYPOTHESIS RESULT ===
âœ… HYPOTHESIS CONFIRMED (MEDIAN): LPLT saves 7.2% energy
   at the cost of 17.2% slower median response times

=== SUMMARY ===
Trade-off ratio: 7.2% energy savings for 17.2% performance cost
